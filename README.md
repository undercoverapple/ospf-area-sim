# OSPF Area Simulation
This script was used to generate graphs showing the estimated network latency for various OSPF area sizes.

Run "python sim.py" to see an example of the network topology used.

Run "python sim.py N" to see a graph showing the expected network latency in an OSPF network with up to N routers.
For example "python sim.py 1500" shows a graph with up to 1500 routers.
